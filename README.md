# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is an application that utilizes both frontend and backend techniques. The user takes a short personality quiz, and he/she is matched with a friend based on their answers!

The user's data is then stored in an API so that they can match with future users! The application uses the Express framework to connect to GET and POST data to the API.
